**Starting these Challenges**

You will need to **FORK** this repository (repo) to your own account.  After you have forked it to your account, you will then need to **CLONE** that repo to your computer.  By doing this, you will be able to work through the challenges and push your code back to your own repo.  All instructions are within each file.  Below details the instructions for both challenges.

**1.1 Loops & Conditionals Challenge**

1. Write a for loop that counts from 0-10. Each time the loop runs, it should invoke a callback function (see step 2).

    1. Declare a function named callback. This function needs to accept a parameter. Inside the function, console.log each number (0-10) from the previously written for loop. Your console should look like the screenshot below.
        - After you've successfully console.logged 0-10 (as pictured above), move on to step 3.

    2. Inside of the callback function, write a conditional that checks if the number is even or odd. If the number is even, console.log 'the number is even'. If the number is odd, console.log 'the number is odd'. Your console should now look like the screenshot below.

**1.2 Arrays & Objects Challenge**

1. Write an object literal that stores information about your favorite movie. nameOfMovie, runTime, characters, and genre should be keys directly inside the object.
        - characters will be an array that should store no more than 2 character objects, each of which stores name, age, and items.
        - items itself will also be an array that should store no more than 2 item objects. These items objects can have key-value pairs of whatever you would like (ex. {itemOne: 'Bow and Arrow'}).

    - use console.log statements to show that you can print out the nameOfMovie, runTime, the characters, the name of a character, and one of the items a character has. Your console should look similar to the screenshot below.
